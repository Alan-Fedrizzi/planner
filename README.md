Project from the course: **[NLW 16 Journey React-Native](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/classroom/nlw-16-journey-react-native/)** by **[RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/)**.

## Mobile

```ts
cd mobile
```

```ts
npm i
```

In the file mobile/src/server/api.ts, insert the IP of your machine.

```ts
npm start
```

## Backend

PS: I didn't code the backend, I got the files provided by the course.

```ts
cd server
```

```ts
npm i
```

```ts
npm run dev
```

To see the data in the backend:

```ts
npm run db:studio
```
